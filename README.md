This file is just about to create "Hello World"program in Typescript and Java
# TypeScript:
- *TypeScript* is a statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- Needs to be *compiled* to JavaScript.
- Example: console.log("Hello, World!");

# Java:
- *Java* is platform-independent and object-oriented.
- Runs on the *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)*.
- Example: System.out.println("Hello,Â World!");
